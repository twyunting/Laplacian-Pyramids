### Purpose
Suppose we start with two images: apple and orange. We need to blend two
image into one, consider taking the left half of the apple and combine
it beside each other with the right half of the orange to create a
blending picture. However, if we combine these two directly, the
blending picture will be very unnatural, and we will see the middle line
split between apple and orange. The main idea is that we need to use
Gaussian filter (low pass) and Laplacian filter (high pass) to generate
pyramids and then smoothly blend two different images into one. Here is
a following step:

1.  `def interpolate(image):` Interpolates an image with upsampling rate r=2.This needs to be scaled up since the kernel has a unit area.
2.  `def decimate(image):` Decimates an image with downsampling rate r=2.
3.  `def pyramids(image):` Constructs Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids. G is the Gaussian pyramid, L is the Laplacian pyramid.
4.  `def pyramidBlending(A, B, mask):` We have three images as input: input 1 and input 2 are the images we want to blend with, the third image is a mask image. The mask makes the image blend smooth. In this function, we call back the pyramids function spliting to three images to Gaussian and Laplacian pymarid. The picture blends smoothly when the Gaussian filter is applied to the subsampled mask. The mask's aim is to assist us in combining the Laplacian pyramids for both inputs. Finally, we apply the combined Laplacian to the original Gaussian-resized images multiplied by their respective masks to recreate the original image at each dimension. The following formula is`LS(i, j) = GR(I, j)\*LA(I, j) + (1-GR(I, j)\*LB(I, j))`.
5.  `def reconstruct(pyramid):` The next step is reconstructing the pyramids as well as upsampling and add up with each level. We need to reconstruct the original image using laplacian pyrimads of the image. The ideal idea is to reverse the order of the pyramids in order to start with the smallest pyramid.
6.  `def colorBlending(img1, img2, mask):` We know that a combination of three colors, namely Red, Green, and Blue, is an easy way to describe each pixel in image. This is what we are called the RGB image. In this case, we extract the RGB color from two images which we want to blend with, then call back the `reconstruct` and `pyramidBlending` functions we mentioned before to accomplish our final goal.

### Applications

We use Gaussian pyramid to blur and downsample image for each level. In order to eliminate the difference between each downsample image and the original image, we also compute the difference between the upsampled Gaussian pyramid level (k+1) and the Gaussian pyramid level(k). Laplacian Pyramids are a fantastic way to combine two images together. We can do a lot of things with image blending, such as texture synthesis, image compression, noise removal , and computing image
features.

## Implement Poisson image blending

*Example of code in Python*

    # Import libraries
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import cv2
    import imageio
    from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow
    
    def PoissonImageBlending(source, destination):
      # create an all "White" mask: 255, if black mask is 0
      mask = 255 * np.ones(destination.shape, destination.dtype) 
      # navigate the source img location
      width, height, channels = source.shape
      center = (height//2, width//2)
    
      # using built-in funtion `cv2.seamlessClone` to acommpulish Poisson Image
      blended = cv2.seamlessClone(destination, source, mask, center, 2) # cv::MIXED_CLONE = 2
      output = blended
      imageio.imsave("output.png", output)
      img = cv2.imread("output.png")
      cv2_imshow(img)

    # run it!!
    source = imageio.imread("dc.jpg")
    destination = imageio.imread("moon.jpeg")
    PoissonImageBlending(source, destination)
